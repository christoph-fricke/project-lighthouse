# Project Lighthouse
### What is this?
This project was completed as a task given from university.
The goal was to create a implementation of breakout that is
playable on so called lighthouse.
We went a little bit further and added a little end boss to our
implementation. The game can be played at a computer or at the
lighthouse. However the last option is not available to the
public since the lighthouse is only accessible for playing during
private events. That being said you can still play this game on your
computer. Just download the
[jar](https://github.com/christoph-fricke/project-lighthouse/blob/master/Breakout.jar?raw=true)
and start playing.

### What is the lighthouse?
The lighthouse is a little skyscraper at the [Christan-Albrechts-University zu Kiel](http://www.uni-kiel.de/).
During a student project all windows of the skyscraper where supplied with
LED strips which led to the effect that the windows glow like pixels of a monitor.
Each "pixel" can be controlled individually so it is basically a big computer monitor.

### Background Story
Your ship has crashed on the planet "35367", home planet of the mysterious BBlocks.
They look very dangerous and definitely want to kill you, or do they?
Luckily you have your good old football back from earth with you.
It might work as a weapon.
Can you escape and find your way back home?
